# Smile-detection
This project uses OpenCV's Haar cascade classifiers for real-time smile detection from a webcam feed. It detects faces and smiles, drawing rectangles around smiles and labeling them. The script processes the video feed in grayscale and applies classifiers for detection. Requires Python 3.x and OpenCV. Press 'q' to quit.
